* Head to your local work space ````$ cd $REPO````

* ````$ cd proto-react-app````

* The Amplify CLI is a tool that allows you create and configure AWS services for your application. Its purpose is to simplify mobile and web application development for you. The CLI uses AWS CloudFormation and nested stacks, which allows you to add or modify configurations locally before you push them for execution in the ‚òÅÔ∏è.
* ````$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli````

* If DO NOT have aws configures on your local (~/.aws/config, ~/.aws/credentials), the you can set that up by running the command below.

    * Then 'react' as the framework. 
    * Select the defaults (Enter) for:
        * Source Path. 
        * Distribution Path (We will build this project later. For now, just hit Enter for the default).
        * Build command. 
        * Start commands.

    * Finally, select the profile you want to use. In my case, I the choose 'default' option, becuase that's what it was named in my aws config files. <br><br>

    (~/.aws/config) <br>
    ````[default]```` <br>
    ````output = json```` <br>
    ````region = us-east-1````

    (~/.aws/credentials) <br>
    ````[default]```` <br>
    ````# personal account```` <br>
    ````aws_access_key_id = AKIAJZ5*************```` <br>
    ````aws_secret_access_key = lWleI+J*********************************```` <br><br>

* RUN LOCALLY
* ````$ npm start```` <br><br>

    * Hit Enter to select the default for error doc.
